```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Load the Tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

### FEV dataset

Our data is in file fev.csv, we will save it in a dataframe called fev_data:

```{r}
fev_data <- read_csv("fev.csv")
```

**Problem 1**: Which subjects are male and which are female? (i.e. what does sex == 1 mean?)

From the variables in our dataset, the only one that could be related to sex is height: we might expect that men are generally taller than women.

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(mean(height), sd(height))
```
This seems to imply that 1 == men. But are men taller than women in a young age? Let's look at the ages included in our dataset:

```{r}
table(fev_data$age)
```
We have people from 3 to 19 years old. Perhaps we should only look at older people:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(age>15) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(mean(height), sd(height))
```
Or we could group by sex and age:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(age,sex) %>%
  summarise(n(),mean(height), sd(height)) %>%
  arrange(desc(age)) %>%
  print(n=40)
```

It does seem that people with sex == 1 at older ages are taller, so this suggests that 1 == men. 

**Problem 2**: Why do smokers appear to have better lung function (higher forced expiratory volume - FEV)?

Let's check first: is this true?

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(smoke) %>%
  summarise(mean(fev))
```
It does seem that smokers have higher FEV. But FEV is also dependent on age: younger people have lower FEV. As before, we could group by both smoke and age:  

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(age,smoke) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(fev), sd = sd(fev)) %>%
  filter(n>5) %>%  # here I am only including rows where we have at least five people - to remove low counts
  arrange(desc(age))
```

Now we can compare smoker and non-smokers at the same age, and we can see the smokers generally have lower FEV, as expected.

You could also answer these questions by producing appropriate plots.
