### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 


### R Studio Layout

**Bottom left**: "Console" window. This is where you interact with R - type a command and press Enter, and you will see the results. When you close R studio, anything you type in the Console is forgotten. For code you want to run again, use the "Source" window.

**Top left**: "Source" window. This is where you type your code and save it as an R script file (like this one), so you can run is as many times as you like.

**Top right**: "Environment" window. This shows you the list of all data you have currently available.

**Bottom right**: This is where your plots will be displayed. Under the "packages" tab it shows the packagers currently installed and loaded (more on that below). The "Help" tab is also quite handy!


### R as a calculator

In the Console window below, type: 2+2 and press Enter
Also try:

```{r}
2^5
3/10
(3+5)^2
sqrt(4)
```

Tip: To run a line (or multiple lines) of code from a script without typing them into the Console, 
select the line(s) you want to run and press Ctrl+Enter (Command+Enter on a Mac)


### Objects

R stores data as objects. You create new objects when you assign a value to them using "<-":

```{r}
x <- 3  # Check the "Environment" window!
```

Tip: use the R studio shortcut Alt+ - (Alt and the minus sign) to easily create the assignment symbol <-

```{r}
y <- 6
x+y
```


Tip: R is case sensitive so if you've defined your object as x, it will not recognise (capital) X. 
Similarly, the function for square root is sqrt, R will give you an error if you try to use Sqrt.


### Packages

Packages extend the functionality of base R. They are distributed via CRAN: the Comprehensive R Archive Network

To install a package, use: install.packages("packagename")
You then need to load it, using library(packagename)

We will be using a collection of packages called the Tidyverse:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

When you load the tidyverse, you'll see a message about conflicts. As there is an (increasingly) large number of packages in R, it is possible to have functions with the same name in more than one package. The message tells you that packages dplyr and stats both have a function called filter and the one that will be used is the one from dplyr. It is the one that was loaded last.

If you want to use a function from a particular package, you need to include packagename:: before the name of the function.

In this example, you can use stats::filter() instead of just filter() to use filter from the stats package.

```{r}
find("filter") # this shows you the packages a function belongs to, in order of priority
```

The tidyverse packages we will be using mostly are readr (for reading in data), dplyr (for transforming data) and ggplot2 (for plotting). 


### Functions

When using the Tidyverse, you can call functions in two ways:

```{r}
sqrt(4) # base R

4 %>%
  sqrt  # "pipe" operator (you can read is as "and then...")
```

Tip: use the R Studio shortcut Ctrl + Sft + M to create the pipe operator %>%

Tip: If you are not sure what a function does, type ?functionname in the Console:

```{r}
?sqrt
```


### Reading in data

To read in a comma-separated value (csv) file, use the read_csv function:

```{r}
fev_data <- read_csv("fev.csv")
```

Tip: If you got an error that "fev.csv" does not exist, check that you are working in the correct directory!

Look at the top few rows of the data frame:

```{r}
head(fev_data)
```


Tip: if your data is in a Microsoft Excel spreasheet, you will need a different package to read it in, such as readxl. So you'll need:

install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
excel_data <- read_xlsx(filename, sheet = 1) #(to read the first sheet)


--> Apply the summary function to fev_data. What does it do?

```{r}
summary(fev_data) 
```


### Operating on data: columnns

Individual columns are identified using the $ symbol:

```{r}
head(fev_data$fev)
summary(fev_data$fev)
length(fev_data$fev)
```

Other useful functions for data frames:

```{r}
names(fev_data)
dim(fev_data)
```

Other useful functions for columns:

```{r}
max(fev_data$fev)
mean(fev_data$fev)
sd(fev_data$fev)
```


### Operating on data: subsets

To select subsets of the data (not just columns with $) use square brackets:

```{r}
fev_data$fev[32] # 32nd element of the fev column

fev_data[32,3] # 32nd element of the 3rd column

fev_data[32,"age"]  # Same thing, but using the name of the 3rd column - better, as it is more readable and robust

fev_data[32, ] # Everything in the 3rd row

fev_data[32,1:3]

fev_data[32,-5]

fev_data[32,-1:-2]

fev_data[32,c(1,3,5)] #c(1,3,5) is a vector of numbers (c means "combine")

c(1,3,5) %>%
  length
```

--> How would you drop the 1st, 3rd and 5th column?

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```


### Logicals

Besides numbers and strings of characters, R also stores logicals - TRUE and FALSE

Example: a new vector with elements that are TRUE if height is above 72 cm and FALSE otherwise:

```{r}
is_tall <- fev_data$height > 72
```

Useful summary command:

```{r}
table(is_tall)
```

Which subjects in fev_data are tall?

```{r}
fev_data[is_tall,]
```


### Filtering (selecting rows)

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(height > 72)

fev_data %>%
  filter(age == 6)

fev_data %>%
  filter(age != 20)

fev_data %>%
  filter(age <= 20)
```

You can also filter by whether data are not a number (na):

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(is.na(age))  # opposite: !is.na(age)
```

You can combine multiple expressions with Boolean operators: & is “and”, | is “or”, and ! is “not”

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(age == 14 & smoke !=0)   # age is 14 AND smoker

fev_data %>%
  filter(age < 5 | height < 50)  # younger than 5 OR shorter than 50 cm
```

Rules for filtering for categorical data:
sex == "F" or sex != "F"
sex %in% c("M","F")


### Selecting columns

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  select(fev, height, age)


fev_data %>%
  select(-seqnbr, -subjid)
```


### Summarising data

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(age == 14 & smoke != 0) %>%
  summarise(mean(fev))
```

You can name the summary variable:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(age == 14 & smoke != 0) %>%
  summarise(my_mean = mean(fev))


fev_data %>%
  filter(age == 14 & smoke != 0) %>%
  summarise(mean(fev), sd(fev))
```

To get the average FEV for both smokers and non-smokers we don't need to repeat for smoke==0. We can create a grouping variable:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(smoke)
```
(Same exact data, it just prints the two groups)

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(smoke) %>%
  summarise(mean(fev), sd(fev))
```

But what is the size of each group? n() gives us the number of observations in each group:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(smoke) %>%
  summarise(n = n(), mean = mean(fev), sd = sd(fev))
```

You can also group by your own variables:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(height < 60) %>%
  summarise(n(), mean(fev))
```

A useful function: arrange

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(n(), mean(fev)) %>%
  arrange(age) # arrange by increasing age

fev_data %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarise(n(), mean(fev)) %>%
  arrange(desc(age)) # arrange by decreasing age

```

Sorting columns

```{r}
fev_data$age %>% sort #Sort a column

fev_data$age %>% unique %>% sort # Sort unique values in a column
```

table() gives you a count of a particular factor or combination of factor levels:

```{r}
table(fev_data$age)
table(fev_data$age,fev_data$smoke)
```



--> **Problem 1**: Which subjects are male and which are female? (i.e. what does sex == 1 mean?) If this was a real dataset, we would expect to have this information, but let's pretend we don't. Are there any variables in the datasets we could use to infer this?

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```
--> **Problem 2**: Why do smokers appear to have better lung function (higher forced expiratory volume - FEV)?

```{r}
# Add your code here!
```

Useful function: rename

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  rename(ID = subjid)
```

Mutate: compute new column

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(heightdiff = height - mean(height))
```

Remember that to save these changes you need to assign to a new data frame:

```{r}
new_fev_data <- fev_data %>%
  rename(id = subjid) %>%
  mutate(heightdiff = height - mean(height))
```


### Plotting

The first step to using ggplot is creating a blank canvas:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev))   # aes stands for "aesthetic"
```


### Scatterplots

We add points using geom_point:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point()
```

Add limits, labels, title:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylim(0, 7) +
  ylab("Forced exhalation\nvolume (litres)") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of FEV")
```

We can change the colour of the points (colour - but you can also use col or color), the shape of the points (shape) and the size in mm (size):

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5, shape = 18, colour = "blue")  # Shape 18 is filled diamond
```

Tip: Find out more about ggplot's aesthetic specifications here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/ggplot2-specs.html

To colour by sex, we add the variable as aesthetic element:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(sex = as.character(sex)) %>% # change sex from continuous to categorical variable
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = sex))
```

Add a smooth line fitted to the data:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(sex = as.character(sex)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = sex)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

One line per sex:

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(sex = as.character(sex)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = sex)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(colour=sex))
```

### Line plots

```{r}
fev_average <- fev_data %>%
  group_by(age, smoke) %>%
  summarise(fev_mean = mean(fev))
```

This is not quite right:

```{r}
fev_average %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev_mean)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = smoke))  # smoke is a continuous numeric variable!
```

This is better :)

```{r}
fev_average %>%
  mutate(smoke = as.character(smoke)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev_mean)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = smoke))
```


### Bar plots

How many subjects smoke?

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  mutate(smoke = as.character(smoke)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = smoke)) + 
  geom_bar()  # by default, the y variable is the count of the x (in this case, number of smokers)

```

How many men and how many women smoke / don't smoke?

```{r}
fev_count <- fev_data %>%
  group_by(sex, smoke) %>%
  summarise(smoke_count = n())
```

It might be easier to replace 0 and 1 with meaningful words...

```{r}
fev_count <- fev_data %>%
  mutate(Smoke = ifelse(smoke == 1, "Smoker", "Non-smoker"),
         Sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "Male", "Female")) %>%
  group_by(Sex, Smoke) %>%
  summarise(Count = n())

fev_count %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Smoke, y = Count, fill = Sex)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",     # "identity" allows us to specify a y variable, otherwise it is count (as above)
           position = "dodge") +  # Put bars side-by-side instead of stacked
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Spectral")
```

### Box plots

```{r}
fev_data %>%
  filter(age < 18 & age > 9) %>%
  mutate(smoke = as.character(smoke),
         age = as.character(age)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev, colour = smoke)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_bw()
```

This was a quick tour of the Tidyverse, which showed you how to read in, manipulate, and plot data. In this course, we will give you the code you need, so you won't have to write your own code, but hopefully you will now be able to recognise the most common structures and functions.

If you are a beginner, don't worry if you haven't understood everything, it takes practice! Talk with your group members, as some of them may have more experience using R.
