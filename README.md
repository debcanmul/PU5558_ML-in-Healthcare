#Week 3 Computer Practical - Introduction to R (Revision)

#For this week's exercise, download and work through the attached R markdown file (R_tidyverse.Rmd), which will give you a quick tour of how to read in, manipulate, and plot data in R. You will also need to download the data file fev.csv, which contains a toy dataset of demographic data, smoking status and measured forced expiratory volume. Remember to save the R markdown file and the data in the R project you've created for this course.
